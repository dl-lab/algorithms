In general, any languages/frameworks/tools are welcome for the implementation of deep learning related algorithms.

However, it is strongly recommended that Caffe, Theano or Torch could be used. You are free to select anyone among them.Of course, you can also implement your own framework by yourself, if you like.

May you enjoy coding.
